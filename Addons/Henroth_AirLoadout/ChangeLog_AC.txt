Change log:

0.1.0 - 07/Sept/2014 - Henroth

- "Play Music" button in options menu has been replaced with "Aircraft Loadout Customisation" :)
- Air vehicles prices reduced dramatically.
- Air vehicles when built come with no weapons.
- Air vehicles can have their weapon load-out customised when near an ammo depot by clicking "Aircraft Loadout Customisation" button.
- Air vehicles can have weapons added even if they were researched after the vehicle was built.
- Air vehicles after choosing a load-out need to "rearm" before said load-out appears.
- Air vehicle can have weapons un-mounted and reclaim 100% of weapon cost.
- Some air vehicle have more weapon options than their vanilla loadouts.
- All air vehicles now have flares as a minimal level of customisation ( once researched ).
- A small number of air units have been removed as they were problematic and require some "solving"
before implementing their weapon customisation code. The list of removals include:
* UAV ( not CAS version .. that remains )
* Hellcat ( weaponised version ).


0.1.1 - 10/Sept/2014 - Henroth

- Typhoon now has an Anti-Air loadout to balance AA capabilities of CSAT.
- Fixed silent errors when accepting a loadout with no vehicle selected.
- Fixed a rearm bug.
- Tweaks to UI.

0.1.2 - 10/Sept/2014 - Henroth

- Typhoon now has an Anti-Air loadout to balance AA capabilities of CSAT.
- Fixed silent errors when accepting a loadout with no vehicle selected.
- Fixed a rearm bug.
- Tweaks to UI.


0.1.3 - 12/Sept/2014 - Henroth
- Fixed bug where Pawnee rockets were unlocked without researching FFAR.
- Fixed bug with UAV's not mounting flares correctly.
- Fixed UI bug when selecting another players vehicle in loadout menu, displaying strange text in currently mounted window. It now instead displays
a warning about the fact that you don't own the vehicle ( and can't customise it as a result ).


- Partial loadout, typhoon, fuill loadout , only 3 instead of 4 ATGMS
- Disconnect mid loadout = vehicle perpetually locked - no more actions possible

Things to work on next:
- Put back the missing vehicles and get them to work.
- Increasing the weapon customisation options for each vehicles. Right now 
  the jets are the most customisable with the greatest option of weapon choices followed by the UAV (CAS).
- Anything else that others might care to see that is in the spirit of this mod ( i.e bring a richness of customisation to air vehicles ).
