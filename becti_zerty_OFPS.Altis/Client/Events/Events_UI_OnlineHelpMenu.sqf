You may choose to buy a vehicle manned or empty (you may also buy a vehicle without a driver, gunner, commander or turrets).<br /><br />
A <t color='#eaff96'>Control Center</t> will increase the purchase range of the different factories and add new commanding features to the Commander.<br /><br />

The responsabilities that falls on the Commander are heavier than a regular player. It is recommended to practice this role in SinglePlayer if you're not used to it (your team may be very angry at you otherwise).<br /><br />
Your very first duty as Commander is to find a suitable <t color='#eaff96'>Base Location</t>, the perfect area should be flat, easily defensible and not too far away from the battlefield.<br /><br />
Your second duty as Commander is to <t color='#eaff96'>Construct the Base</t>. <t color='#eaff96'>Barracks</t> and <t color='#eaff96'>Control Center</t> are a good choice for a start. Once you've decided on the location, you can open the <t color='#eaff96'>Build Menu</t> and place the desired structures. Those structures will appear as 'ruins' at first as they must be built up. Don't forget to hire <t color='#eaff96'>Workers</t> to construct the structures (Keep in mind that you're on a low budget at first!).<br /><br />
From now on, the strategy is entirely up to you. You may create a <t color='#eaff96'>Light Vehicle Factory</t> for your side so that they may move faster to the battlefield or save up for a <t color='#eaff96'>Heavy Vehicle Factory</t> in order to perform an heavy attack. <t color='#eaff96'>Defenses</t> are very important in your base as enemy players may close in at any time!<br /><br />
Don't forget that a good Commander shall balance the needs of the base and the needs of his team.

As infantry you are able to connect to either of those elements <br />
The following are the effective <t color='#e8bd12'>ranges</t> of connection depending on types <br />
  - Infantry:  100m + 200m * (Upgrade Level)<br />
  - Vehicle: 1000m + 1000m * (Upgrade Level) <br />
  - Town : 5 km<br />
